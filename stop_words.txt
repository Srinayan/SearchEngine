researchers focused two common types intermittent fasting diets first based time restrictions eating dieter may fast number hours per day instance 16 hours allowing eat anything theyd like remaining hours intermittent fasting increase weight loss intermittent fasting work read second type intermittent fasting dieters may choose alternate days total fasting days food limits may simply alternate
